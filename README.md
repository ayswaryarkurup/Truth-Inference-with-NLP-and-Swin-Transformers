# Truth-Inference-with-NLP-and-Swin-Transformers
This repository contains the  implementation details of a truth inference model that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with transfer learning using Swin transformers. Unlike traditional transformer architectures, the Swin transformer employs a shifted windowing technique that effectively captures both local and global contextual features in textual data. This approach helps to generate more accurate embedding representations, specifically fine-tuned for nuances of crowdsourced tasks.
